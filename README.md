## Overview
This project explores the strengths and limitations of various algorithms in solving Sudoku puzzles. It integrates a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with `Tkinter` for easy user interaction and visual representation of the puzzle-solving process.

## Features
- Solve Sudoku puzzles using:
  - Backtracking algorithm
  - Constraint Propagation
  - Belief Propagation
- GUI for loading, solving, and interacting with Sudoku puzzles.
- Four difficulty levels: Default, Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- Real-time performance feedback (time taken and iterations).

## Installation
